    <p>This chilled Hydromelon and Radish soup is accurate to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of
        the Wild, and is garnished with a heart shaped slice of Voltfruit. According to Ashai from
        Gerudo Town, those who master the creation of Creamy Heart Soup are said to be able to
        master anything!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 dragon fruit</li>
        <li>1 ripe Honeydew Melon</li>
        <li>2 small baby radishes, halved</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar (12 g)</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt, or unsweetened almond yogurt (245 g)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coconut milk (60 ml)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey (30 ml)</li>
        <li>2 ripe bananas, peeled</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh beets, finely diced, for color (10 g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and cut your dragon fruit in half. Cut one half into 1/2 inch slices (1.25
            cm), then carefully cut these slices into 2 hearts. On the other half, use the melon
            baller to make balls, then put them into a mixing bowl. Set the hearts aside.</li>
        <li>Use the melon baller on the honeydew melon next, you want 8 small melon balls.
            Put them into the mixing bowl, and add halved radishes, and sugar. Mix gently, then
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Put 2 cups of the remaining ripe melon, yogurt, honey, bananas, and beets into
            the blender, and puree until very smooth. The blend should be a light pink; if not,
            add a bit more beets and blend again. Pour into two serving bowls. Chill in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>To serve, retrieve bowls, add an even portion of melon and dragon fruit balls to
            each, and garnish with the dragon fruit heart shape. Enjoy!</li>
