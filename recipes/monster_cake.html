    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup butter, room temperature (150 g)</li>
        <li>1 2/3 cups sugar (375 g)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups milk (320 ml)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (5 ml)</li>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour (300 g)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cocoa powder (40 g)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda (5.75 g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (5.6 g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Add butter and
            sugar to a large bowl, mix until smooth. Add eggs, milk, and vanilla extract, then
            beat until smooth. In a new dry bowl, combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt;
            mix thoroughly. Slowly add the dry mix to the large bowl, mixing until everything is
            added and smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into a greased round cake tin, mini cakes tin, cupcake tin, or, my
            favorite, a mini cupcake tin.</li>
        <li>Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, depending on your tin. An inserted toothpick should
            come out clean or with a few crumbs, no wet batter. Cool for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Continue with Frosting Directions</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Frosting and Horns</h1>
    <h2>Frosting Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 and 3/4 cups powdered sugar (470 g)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil or butter (45 ml)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vanilla almond milk (60 ml)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract (10 ml)</li>
        <li>Monster Extract or purple food coloring</li>
        <li>~1 tablespoon cocoa powder (8 g) for coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Horns Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces of white chocolate (450 g)</li>
        <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup corn syrup (80 to 120 ml)</li>
        <li>Monster Extract or purple food dye</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Frosting Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Horns: melt the white chocolate, either in a double boiler, microwave, or carefully over a fire. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes, so you can touch it comfortably</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 cup corn syrup to the bowl of chocolate, stir until absorbed. Pour onto
            a cool clean surface, like a counter or shield. Knead the chocolate and add small
            amounts of corn syrup until it reaches a good consistency, like play dough.</li>
        <li>Add the monster extract a little at a time, kneading it through until it is purple!</li>
        <li>Prepare a tray for the finished horns. For one large cake, make 2 large balls. For
            many smaller cakes, separate the chocolate into similarly sized balls, enough for 2
            horns per cake. Roll each ball into a little pointed cone, then gently curve the cone.
            Once each horn is done, place the tray in the refrigerator to harden.</li>
        <li>Frosting: You can buy or make your frosting! Youâ€™ll need half chocolate, and half
            purple. To make, add all frosting ingredients to a new bowl except Monster Extract
            and cocoa powder. Beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. You want it very thick,
            but spreadable.</li>
        <li>In a new bowl, dye one half purple for the center frosting. Dye the other half
            brown with cocoa powder for the top frosting. Alter the consistency and color if necessary; if the frosting is too thin, add more powdered sugar, too thick, more milk.</li>
        <li>Cut each cake or cupcake carefully in half, unless they are small enough to use
            two per cake. Spread the purple frosting in their centers, then reassemble them.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate frosting to a pipette bag or a zip lock bag with a tiny hole in
            the corner. Add a chocolate swirl to the top of each cake.</li>
        <li>Add two horns to each cake, pointed upwards. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
