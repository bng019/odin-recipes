    <p>This is a surf and turf style dish that combines succulent beef with ahi tuna, seared and
        served with a tangy sauce. This recipe is for medium rare, but cook to your desired taste</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound beef tenderloin* (.25 kg)</li>
        <li>1/2 pound sushi grade ahi tuna (.25 kg)</li>
        <li>Sea Salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons oil (45 ml)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cilantro (50 g)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (8 g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced ginger (3 g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic (3 g)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce (45 ml)</li>
        <li>1 lime worth of freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar (4 g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare beef tenderloin and ahi tuna by slicing into 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) thick fillets.
            Pat dry, then season all sides with salt and ground black pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine sesame seeds, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, ginger, soy sauce,
            sugar, and 1 tablespoon oil (15 ml).</li>
        <li>Oil your skillet with 2 tablespoons oil (30 ml), preheat to medium high.</li>
        <li>Once the skillet is hot, sear the fillets for one to two minutes on each side. Decrease the heat to medium and add the sauce. Mix and check meat with a knife to
            make sure it is cooked to your taste. If it needs more time, increase heat, cover, and
            flip meat every few minutes until you are satisfied. Once the sauce is simmering, it is
            ready to serve. Cut the fillets into chunks if you choose, serve it with left over sauce
            from the skillet drizzled over the top, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Vegan- This is a mainly meat dish, but the sauce goes well with firm tofu and
        mushroom fillets.</p>
